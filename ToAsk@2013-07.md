4. Is the O_NONBLOCK option supported for regular files ?
	>It's allowed, but it has no effect, because reading a regular file neverblocks.If there's no data available, you must be at the end of the file, so read() returns 0 immediately to indicate EOF. It doesn't block when you don't use O_NONBLOCK, so it doesn't return an error with errno = EWOULDBLOCK when you use O_NONBLOCK
